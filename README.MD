A Ruby CLI program that gives you the value of a resistor given the number and color of its bands.

Written in a lazy, rainy afternoon by Guglielmo Chelazzi Grandinetti, a wannabe developer who needs some Ruby practice

Type "ruby $PATH/execute.rb", the program will prompt you to describe your resistor and give you its values.
